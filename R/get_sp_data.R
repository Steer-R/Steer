#' Get roads from a state of the US, from TIGER API
#'
#' `get_sp_data()` download a spatial dataset, using an API connection to TIGER/Line Shapefiles. This dataset include a
#' spatial feature object with the downloaded variables. The dataset may be stored locally in the R session, or saved
#' directly to a specified path.
#'
#' @param year The year of the spatial object, according to the US Census Bureau
#' @param state A character vector of the two-digit FIPS code of the state you'd like to download the roads for. Can also
#'  be state name or abbreviation (case-insensitive). Default to "PR"
#' @param unified (Logical) `TRUE` if the resultant spatial object must be a unique dataset with all road types (with a type
#' identifier column). `False` if a separate dataset should be returned for each road type.
#' @param path The path where the resultant dataset will be stored. If omitted, the dataframe will be available only
#'  locally
#' @param name The name of the resultant file. Default to "data_pr"
#' @param file_type (string) The extension used to save the dataset. It can be a spatial object (i.e., "shp", "gpkg", "gdb")
#' or a text object (i.e., "csv", "txt"). The string must not include the intial dot. Default to "gpkg".
#' @param county (Optional) The county to retrieve the spatial feature. If `NULL`, roads from all counties will be returned.
#'  Default to `NULL`
#'
#' @return
#' If unified is `TRUE`, the output will be a spatial dataframe with the roads of the county or counties of the desired
#' state, each road will be classified as Primary, Secondary, Minor, Ramp, or Other, in the column type. If unified is
#'  `FALSE`, the output will be five spatial dataframes, one for each road type.

#' * The classification by road type is made using the MAF/TIGER Feature Class Code (MTFCC, see
#'  \href{https://www.census.gov/library/reference/code-lists/mt-feature-class-codes.html}{MAF/TIGER Feature Class Code
#'  Definitions}). Each road type has an associated MTFCC, which for this case, is translated to a string indicating the
#'  road type associated.
